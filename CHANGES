In this file we record the changes since the first GAP 4 release of
the GUAVA package.

Version 3.19 (3-2024)
   o Fix various issues in the C source code, including potential buffer
     overflows and many compiler warnings
   o Various other minor and/or janitorial changes

Version 3.18 (1-2023)
   o Enhance the `configure` script to accept `--with-gaproot=PATH`

Version 3.17 (9-2022)
   o Add back QCLDPCCodeFromGroup method (it was accidentally removed
     between Guava 3.8 and 3.9)
   o Fix out of bounds access in the C code
   o Fix most (all?) compiler warnings in the C code
   o Fix PutStandardForm *again*
   o Update several outdated manual examples
   o Avoid accidentally displaying the output of subprocesses to the user
   o Improve the package banner
   o Various minor and/or janitorial changes

Version 3.16 (4-2022)
   o CirculantMatrixi() now circulates to the right.
   o Build of the automorphism group subsystem by Jeff Leon was failing on Macs : fixed

Version 3.15 (8-2019):
   o Fixed decoding of cyclic codes
   o Several updates to build system
   o Updated Travis integration
   
Version 3.14 (4-2018):
   o The external binaries from J. S. Leon and Cen Tjhai can now be used on all 
     architectures (Unix/Linux, MacOS, and Windows) 
   o The bug fix for MinimumWeight() from 3.13 was not sufficiently well tested...
   o The decoding method for cyclic codes fails in certain situations.  We are leaving this as
     a known bug for the moment.
   o A bug fix for MinimumDistanceLeon() from Alex K. 
   o Lots of clean up of the lib files -- removing old comments, obsolete version strings, 
     leftovers from CVS, etc.
   o Constructions were added for several of the optimal codes in the bounds tables that 
     were referenced in the now defunct online table by Brouwer and Verhoeff.

Version 3.13 (2-2016):
   o Incorporated fixes by Dima Pasechnik. 
   o Incorporated fixes by Jerome Benoit.
   o Fixed bug in MinimumWeight() uncovered by Simon Tinius.
   o The infix "in" operator was not working for the case of a codeword 
     in a code, when the code was defined by a generator polynomial.  
   o Fixed BCH decoding 
   o Changes to the test suite:  moved test files to a separate "tst" 
     subdirectory,  added "decoding.tst" file which includes thorough tests 
     of decoding algorithms, modified "guava.tst" so that randomization of 
     input values does not effect output. Added "hadamard.tst" for testing the 
     construction of Hadamard matrices
   o Rewrite of the algorithms for constructing Hadamard matrices.  Hadamard 
     matrices can be constructed using Sylvester's and Paley's (type I and II) 
     methods.  The Paley constructions use properties of the quadratic 
     residues in a finite field, which previously was assumed to be of 
     prime order - GF(p) - now we can also handle extension fields - GF(p^k).
     The smallest order without a construction is now 92.
   o Changes necessitated by switch to GitHub (mostly to the webpage)
   o Added ErrorVector() convenience function for creating small weight
      error vectors from a list of error positions (used in testing Decode()
      methods.)
   o Cleaned up Decode/Decodeword which are supposed to return info. words 
     and corrected codewords respectively.  Many codes with SpecialDecoder 
     functions were doing the wrong thing.
   o Tested against GAP 4.8.1 and made changes necessitated by GAP updates.
     (E.g. ReadTest -> Test)

Version 3.12 (5-2012):
   o More work on configure/make.  Switched "configure" script to that 
     written by Frank Lubeck for Browse. EDIM, etc.
   o Revamped init.g and read.g and the AvailabilityTest function in 
     PackageInfo.g for GAP 4.5 compatibility.
   o Some fixes to guava.tst.  There are now exactly 4 known errors. 
   o Switched bibliography database in /doc to an xml format and repaired
     many LaTeX warnings due to inappropriate Label attributes in 
     <ManSection> tags.

Version 3.11 (1-2012):
   o General editing and improvements to the documentation.
   o Various modifications for compatibility with GAP 4.5.
   o Rework of configure/make process for compiling binaries of subsystems
     written by Leon and Tjhai.
   o Revamped the "guava.tst" file.
   o Bug fix in TraceCode reported by Stanislav Bulygin.

   o Minor changes (permission changes, etc)

Version 3.4 (03-2008):
   o Modified the configure file for the C code (R. Miller).
   o Updated documentation.

Version 3.3 (03-2008):
   o Added new C code written by CJ and a new Guava function MinimumWeight
     which is *much* faster than MinimumDistance (when the ground
     field is GF(2) or GF(3)).
   o Added Andreas Brouwer's patch for Leon's code to avoid some
     memory problems.

Version 3.2 (01-2008):
   o Added a macro for malloc.h in leonconv.c to fix compilation error
     under Mac OS X
   o Added ExtendedReedSolomonCode, QuasiCyclicCode, CyclicMDSCode, 
     FourNegacirculantSelfDualCode, ConstructionXCode, ConstructionXXCode,

   o cjt: Created two functions in codeman.g*, SubCode and 
     ConstructionB2Code. The ConstructionB2Code function is empty
     and to be implemented in a future version.
   o wdj: GUAVA Manual changes.

Version 2.6: Forked off a branch of GUAVA which is entirely

   o Miscellaneous additions to the GUAVA manual.

Version 2.4: (6-2005) Minor bug fix - 
   o In MatrixRepresentationOnRiemannRochSpaceP1,
     cleaned up code and fixed a bug (GAP does not process 1 the 
     same as x^0 in some cases).
   o Fixed spelling error in guava.tst file.

Version 2.3: (5-2005)
   o added PermutationDecoderNC, CyclicDecoder
   o change PermutationGroup in PermutationDecoder
     to PermutationAutomorphismGroup 
   o in codegen.gi, line 2066, replace C.GeneratorMat

Version 2.0001: (12-2004)
   o Merely added PolynomialByExtRepNC to GUAVA. (A *temporary* addition to
     last until GAP 4.4.5 was released.)

Version 2.0: (12-2004)
   o Changed `ViewObj` method for random linear codes, 
     speeding up the implementation of the RandomLinearCode command.
   o Modified BCHCode and RootsCode implementation.
   o Corrected bug in UpperBoundElias.
   o Rewrote GUAVA documentation into GAPDoc, with many revisions.
   o Added EvaluationCode and related codes
     (GeneralizedReedMullerCode, GeneralizedReedSolomonCode, 
      OnePointAGCode, joint with Jason McGowan)

   o CalculateLinearCodeCoveringRadius changed to a slightly faster
     algorithm.
   o minor bug fix for ExhaustiveSearchCoveringRadius
   o minor bug fix for IncreaseCoveringRadiusLowerBound
   o Changed ConstantWeightSubcode so it does not call Leon's
     program if wtdist is not installed. Moreover, the procedure 
     interfacing with the binary had a bug, which was fixed.
   o Added check in AutomorphismGroup: if Leon's desauto is not
     compiled (e.g., on a windows machine) then it calls PermutationGroup 
     command instead.
   o Added Decodeword (which also works for non-linear codes)
   o Added NearestNeighborDecodewords (for linear codes)
