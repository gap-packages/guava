                            History of
                            ----------
                    the GUAVA Coding Theory Package
                    -------------------------------


GUAVA was originally written in  GAP 3  by  Jasper  Cramwinckel,  Erik
Roijackers, and Reinald Baart as a final project during their study of
Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology, Department of  Pure
Mathematics, and in Aachen, at Lehrstuhl D fuer Mathematik.

In version 1.3 (still GAP 3), new functions were added by Eric Minkes,
also from Delft University of Technology.

Version 1.4 (the first GAP 4 version) of  GUAVA  was  created  by  Lea
Ruscio who maintained it through to version 1.5.

Versions of GUAVA from 1.6 to 3.9 were maintained by David Joyner.
Starting with Versions 2.5/2.6, GUAVA was forked: the "odd versions"
(e.g., 2.5) include the code of J. S. Leon mentioned above (which is not
licensed under the GPL at the time). The "even versions" (e.g., 2.6)
were entirely GPL'd, but were otherwise are basically the same as the
previous "odd version" (i.e., "2.6 = 2.5 - non-GPL'd code").

Starting with Versions 2.7/2.8, Cen Tjhai, a PhD student in the
School of Computing, Communications & Electronics at the University of
Plymouth, was added as an author. He completely updated the tables,
which had not been updated since 1998, and added some new functions.

Starting with Versions 3.0, Robert Miller, a PhD student in the
Department of Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle,
and Tom Boothby, (then) an undergraduate in the same department,
were added as authors. They both revised Leon's code,
which was GPL'd on April 17th, 2007:

        I, Jeffrey S. Leon, agree to license all the partition
        backtrack code which I have written under the GPL
       (www.fsf.org) as of this date, April 17, 2007.

The ``even''/``odd'' forks of the GUAVA code are now united.

Joe Fields has been the maintainer since version 3.10.

The current version is 3.14.
