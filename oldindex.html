<p><h2>Description</h2></p>



<p>
GUAVA is a package that implements coding theory
algorithms in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>.

Codes can  be created and manipulated  and
 information about codes can be calculated.
</p>

<p>
GUAVA consists of various files written in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> language, and an
 external program from J. S. Leon for dealing with automorphism groups of
codes and isomorphism testing functions (for the manual
to his program, click <a href="leon_guava_manual.pdf">here</a> for the pdf).
Several algorithms that need the speed are integrated in the
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> kernel.
Please send your bug reports
to <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support</a>.
</p>


<p>
The functions within GUAVA can be divided into four categories:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>  Construction of codes. GUAVA can construct non-linear, linear and
cyclic codes over an arbitrary finite field.
Examples are <strong>HadamardCode</strong>, <strong>ReedMullerCode</strong>,
<strong>BestKnownLinearCode</strong>, <strong>QRCode</strong> and
<strong>GoppaCode</strong>.</li>

<li>  Manipulation of codes. These functions allow the user to transform
one code into another or to construct a new code from two codes. Examples
are <strong>PuncturedCode</strong>, <strong>DualCode</strong>,
<strong>DirectProductCode</strong> and <strong>UUVCode</strong>.</li>

<li>  Computation of information about codes. This information is stored in
the code record. Examples are <strong>MinimumDistance</strong>,
<strong>OuterDistribution</strong>, <strong>IsSelfDualCode</strong> and
<strong>AutomorphismGroup</strong>.
</li>

<li>  Generation of bounds on linear codes. The table by Brouwer and
Verhoeff (as it existed in the mid 1990's)
is incorporated into GUAVA. For example,
<strong>BoundsMinimumDistance</strong>.
</li>

</ul>
</p>




<p><h2>History</h2></p>

As of 3.10, <a href="mailto:fieldsj1@southernct.edu">Joe Fields</a> is the lead maintainer.

<p>
<h2>GUAVA and SAGE</h2>
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to begin experimenting with GUAVA is to use it via the
<a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a> (SMC).  One can
sign up for a free SMC account or pay a small amount for a subscription
(which allows for premium access).  Within a SMC project one can create
a sage worksheet and set its default language to <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>.
Then load GUAVA (see below) and try out its features.

<p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
</p>

<p>
A fresh install of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> will include GUAVA by default.  The directions in the next paragraph only apply to those who
find themselves in the unusual situation of not having the default GUAVA installation.  In the
majority of cases you can skip to the following paragraph.
</p>

<p>
To install GUAVA, as a <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4
package, unpack the
archive file in a directory in the `pkg' hierarchy of your version of
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4.
(This might be the `pkg' directory of the
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4 home
directory; it is however also possible to keep an additional `pkg'
directory in your private directories, see section
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/htm/ref/CHAP074.htm">
"Installing GAP Packages"</a> of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4
reference manual for details on how to do this.)
</p>

<p>
After unpacking GUAVA the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>-only
part of GUAVA is installed.  The parts
of GUAVA depending on J. Leon's backtrack programs package (for computing
automorphism groups and code equivalences) are now available in a Window, MacOS and UNIX environments.  For Windows machines, separate instructions are available <a href="windows-compiling.html">here</a>.   For UNIX and MacOS you
should proceed as follows:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> <i>Linux/UNIX installation instructions</i>:

<p>
Go to the newly created `guava' directory and call `./configure <tt>GAPPATH</tt>'
where <tt>GAPPATH</tt> is the path to the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
home directory. The default value for <tt>GAPPATH</tt> is `../..' so if
you install the package in the main `pkg' directory it is sufficient to call
</p>
<pre>./configure </pre><br>
</p>
<p>


</p>

<p>This will fetch the architecture type for which <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> has been compiled
last and create a `Makefile'. Now call
<pre>make<br></pre>
to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.  Note that there is no seperate `<pre>make install</pre> call.
</li>

<li><i>64-bit linux instructions</i>:

The above instructions should suffice to create 64 bit binaries but if there is a problem
one can use the `--enable-libsuffix=64' option to configure to force the issue:

<p>
<pre>./configure ../.. --enable-libsuffix=64 <br>
make<br>
</pre>
</li>

<li><i>Mac OS X instructions</i>:
The linux instructions should work here as well.
</li>

</ul>



<p>This completes the installation of GUAVA for a single architecture.  If
you use this installation of GUAVA on different hardware platforms you
 will have to compile the binary for each platform separately. This is
 done by calling `configure' and `make' for the package anew
 immediately after compiling <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
itself for the respective architecture.  If your version of
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> is already compiled (and has last
been compiled on the same architecture) you do not need to compile
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> again; it is
sufficient to call the `configure' script in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
home directory.
</p>

<p>
Hints for GUAVA installation <i>outside the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
main directory</i>: When you don't have access to
the directory of your main <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
installation you can also install the package
by unpacking inside a directory <tt>MYGAPDIR/pkg</tt>. (Don't forget to call "gap"
with the <tt>-l ";MYGAPDIR"</tt> option.) The only drawback with this installation
is that in the HTML version of the package documentation the links to the
 main <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> manuals don't work.
</p>



<p>
<h2>Loading GUAVA</h2>
</p>

<p>
After starting up <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>,
the GUAVA package needs to be loaded. Load
 GUAVA by typing at the
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> prompt:
</p>
<pre>gap&gt; LoadPackage( "guava" );</pre>
<br>


</p>

<p>
In fact, you can automate this by adding

<pre>LoadPackage("guava");<br></pre>
to your gaprc file. However, if you wish to start <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> via a workspace
with GUAVA preloaded then you should type both
<tt>LoadPackage("sonata");</tt> and <tt>LoadPackage("guava");</tt> before
saving your workspace, since one command in GUAVA (versions 3.8 and higher)
requires
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/sonata.html">SONATA</a>.
