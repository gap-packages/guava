abstract: |
    <span class="pkgname">GUAVA</span> is a <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> package for computing with codes. <span class="pkgname">GUAVA</span> can construct unrestricted (non-linear), linear and cyclic codes; transform one code into another (for example by puncturing); construct a new code from two other codes (using direct sums for example); perform decoding/error-correction; and can calculate important data of codes (such as the minumim distance or covering radius) quickly. Limited ability to compute algebraic geometric codes.
